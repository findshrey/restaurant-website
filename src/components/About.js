                  Located on a then-lonesome little corner under the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn, Exotica opened
                  its doors on New Yearâ€™s Eve twenty years ago. Owners Andrew Tarlow and Mark Firth hosted and
                  bartended and ended most nights with a hand of cards and pitcher of margaritas.
                  <br /> <br />
                  Chef Caroline Fidanza wrote a daily menu committed to local, seasonal, sustainable foods, and built
                  relationships with the farmers in upstate New York and surrounding regions.

                  Exotic's expansive bar, a place to sit, read, eat and watch the world go by is the
                  centerpiece
                  of the room, a 90 year old Pullman dining car. Warm wood and aged enamel, like being in the belly
                  of a whale or the protected hold of a ship.
                  <br /> <br />
                  Twenty years later Exotica has carried on
                  the traditions of its early days. A place of occasion. A touchstone for a neighborhood.
